1. Golden Gate Bridge Problem:

My initial ideas for this problem involved picking some sort of cute trick/outside the box solution that would
allow me to essentially make up a defensible number. This would have been aided by the fact that the question is
pretty vague, giving only the minimum details and not even attempting to restrict the answers. This makes sense
given the nature of the "Code-Foo Challenge".

Before doing any research about the Golden Gate Bridge (it's that big one that's famous or something, right?), I
thought about the other aspect of the problem: pennies. I've seen a few pennies in my life, and your weird American
pennies are close enough to our normal ones that I figured I knew a little bit more about pennies than I knew about
the Golden Gate Bridge. The question then becomes how can I manipulate pennies to exploit the loose boundaries of
this challenge.

A few initial ideas earned additional thought. I considered perhaps altering the state of the pennies, perhaps
melting them down and mixing them in as part of some liquid solution. This solution could then be sprayed on the
bridge and I could pick virtually any number of pennies and challenge you to dispute my claim. At best, I felt this
was a cop out, and it had an obvious weakness: anyone could argue that the pennies would overlap when sprayed, or
even could be considered to be overlapping when they've been mixed. I also looked at a few other ideas, such as
glueing the pennies together edge to edge and building structures of pennies. This also had flaws. If I built
the pennies into spirals, for example, are they then overlapping, even if it's not directly? Additionally, would
the structures hold together? How much weight could they support?

Ultimately I decided to take the more standard approach and research the dimensions of the bridge, with one small
twist: I would stand the pennies up on edge. So on to the math!

Measurements were taken from both http://www.goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBDesign.php and from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge. Penny dimensions taken from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)

Diameter: 19.05 mm (.01905 m)
Thickness: 1.55 mm (.00155 m)
Effective Surface Area of a penny (standing on edge): .01905 m * .00155 m = 0.0002953 m^2 (rounded)
(Because of they way they are stacked on edge against one another, surface area can be calculated as a square)

Total Length of the Bridge: 2737 m
Width of the Bridge: 27 m
Surface Area of the Bridge: 27 m * 2737 m = 73899 m^2

Height of tower above water: 227 m
Base of the tower: 10 x 16 m
Surface Area of the Wide Side: 16 m * 227 m = 3632 m^2
Surface Area of the Narrow Side: 10 m * 227 m = 2270 m^2
Total Surface Area for One Tower: 3632 m^2 * 2 + 2270 m^2 *2 = 11804 m^2
(The towers are tapered, but I decided to calculate them as squares, using the excess as a rough estimate of all
the minor structures for which I did not have measurements)

Length of one main cable: 2332 m
Diameter of one main cable: .92 m
Surface area of the cables: 2(pi)(.46 m)(2332 m) = 6736.68 m^2 (rounded)
(Formula for the surface area of a cylinder, not including the top and bottom of the cylinder, as the cable is
anchored into...something)

Total Surface Area of the Bridge: 73899 m^2 + 73899 m^2 + 11804 m^2 + 11804 m^2 + 6736.68 m^2 = 178142.68 m^2
(The bridge area is counted twice, top and bottom. The sides of the bridge are not included as I did not have
those measurements.)
Number of Pennies That Can Fit On The Bridge: 178142.68 m^2 / 0.0002953 m^2 = 603,260,006 Pennies (and lots of glue)

2. Picture dimensions: 144 x 81, 288 x 162, 432 x 243
All of these have widths that are multiples of 12 and have a 16:9 ratio.

3. It will take 63 moves for the knight to cover every square on the board. Or, 64, if you count placing the knight
on the board as the first move. See the chess board program for the solution, and the pdf for the graph.

4. I grew up on video games. Not exactly a unique response? Well, I'm also willing to leave my family, friends,
home, and even country behind to come work at IGN. I think that demonstrates "fire" more than anything else I
could say.
